Welcome back to round two! Last time we set up the basic structure of your network,
and now we're going to prepare it for the MNIST dataset. But first, let's introduce the dataset!

## 2

In the toolbar, click on the Datasets section. Look for the MNIST dataset
and drag it onto the canvas.

## 3

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits, divided into two parts:
training data and testing data. You can access them from the right side of the dataset.

## 4

Before we can use MNIST, we need to make sure the network is ready.
First, we'll need to adjust the layers.

## 5

Click on the first Dense layer (the one below the Input layer). This will open the settings menu.

## 6

In the settings, change the units to 128. This defines how big the layer is.

## 7

Next, set the activation to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). This helps the network learn more
complex patterns.

## 8

Now, click on the second Dense layer. Set its units to 10. This is the number of
different digits the network will recognize (from 0 to 9).

## 9

Change the activation to Softmax. This will give us a probability distribution about
how likely each digit is in the image.

## 10

Great! Now, letâ€™s configure the Input layer. Set its shape to [28, 28, 1].
This shape matches the size of the images in the MNIST dataset (28x28 pixels,
with 1 color channel for grayscale images).

## 11

Now that the layers are configured, let's make some changes to the network structure.
Remove the connection between the Input layer and the first Dense layer by clicking
on the line and pressing the Delete key.

## 12

Nice work! Now, add a Flatten layer. This layer will convert the 2D image(28x28 pixels) into
a 1D array (784 pixels), which the network can process. Connect the Flatten layer to the
first Dense layer.

## 13

Let's add a Normalization layer to make the image data more manageable for the network.
Now, connect from the Input layer to the Normalization layer and from the Normalization layer
to the Flatten layer.

## 14

You nailed it! Connect the adapt port of the Normalization layer
to the train port of the MNIST dataset.

## 15

Congratulations! Your network is now fully configured and ready to process the MNIST dataset.
The next lesson will cover training the network and evaluating its performance.
