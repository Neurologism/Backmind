They say winners never quit, but in machine learning, knowing when to quit can be the key to success. In this tutorial,
we’ll explore two essential techniques: validation and early stopping. Together, they help your model achieve optimal performance by monitoring its progress and halting training at the right time.

## 2

In the last tutorial, we discussed the issue of overfitting. The question is, how do we prevent it?

## 3

To avoid overfitting, we need to check how well the model is doing during training. Overfitting happens when the model
gets too good at remembering the training data, but struggles with new data.

## 4

To prevent this, we use validation. After each training step (epoch), we test the model on a separate set of
data it hasn't seen before. This helps us see if the model is learning general patterns or just memorizing the training data.

## 5

It's like practicing for a test and checking your answers after each question, to make sure you're learning the right things.

## 6

Let’s add validation to your model. First, we will need another dataset, besides the training and testing data. To do
this, add a Split node from the Dataset section.

## 7

Great! Now, remove the connection between the first split node and the fit node.
Then, connect the split1 connection of the first split node to the input of the new split node.

## 8

In the settings of the new split node, set the ratio to 0.8. This means 80% of the previous training data will be used for training,
and 20% will be used for validation.

## 9

Now connect the split1 connection of the new split node to the data and the split2 connection to the validation data of the fit node.

## 10

Awesome! Your validation setup is complete. Hit the train button and observe the line chart.
The chart shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both the training and validation data.

## 11

You’ll observe a common pattern in the graph: while the training MAE keeps decreasing, the validation MAE keeps steady or starts increasing after a certain point.
This indicates that the model is starting to overfit. Ideally, training should stop at this point.

## 12

This is where early stopping becomes useful. It’s a technique that stops training when the validation error starts increasing
and automatically restores the model to the state where the validation error was at its lowest.

## 13

How do we enable early stopping? Look for the Early Stopping Patience setting in the fit node. Go ahead and set it to 5.
This means training will stop if the validation error doesn’t decrease for 5 consecutive epochs.

## 14

Great! Now hit the train button again and watch the magic happen. The training will stop automatically when early stopping is triggered.

## 15

Congratulations! By using early stopping, you’ve reduced overfitting and decreased training time. This is a powerful technique
that helps achieve better results in less time. Keep experimenting, and stay tuned for more exciting tutorials!
