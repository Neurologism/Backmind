But asking too many people takes a lot of time which is not always available. So, you need to find the right balance
between asking too many people and asking too few. This is where the batch size comes in. The batch size is the number
of people you ask for advice before you take a step in the maze. Now, click on the MNIST node and set the batch size to 64.

You are now asking 64 people for advice before taking a step in the maze. Let's move on to the fit node.
Fit makes your layers(teams of employees) interact with the training data (MNIST dataset). The node has the parameter
epochs. An epoch is like a full day of work for your teams. On each epoch, your teams will ask the whole training data
for advice. So more epochs mean more progress but also more time. Click on the fit node and set the epochs to 5.

Fantastic! You are now ready to train your neural network.
Click the large `Start Training` button at the top of the screen to begin. Best of luck!

Youâ€™re almost there! Hit the big Start Training button at the top of the screen to kick off the training process.

The most important thing to watch is the accuracy, located to the right of the Start Training button.
This percentage tells you how many digits the model correctly recognized.
The higher the accuracy, the better your model has learned to recognize digits in the training data.
Looks like youâ€™re on track to get some great results!

And thatâ€™s a wrap! Youâ€™ve successfully trained your first neural network! Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
In the next tutorial, weâ€™ll dive into how to visualize the results
and understand how well your model has performed.
