Greetings, carbon-based life form! You've done great so far! Let's move on to some new layers: Flatten and Normalization.

## 2

A Flatten layer is like a translator. It takes inputs like images and changes them into a list of numbers,
which Dense layers can process. Start by adding a Flatten layer from the LAYERS section of the toolbar.

## 3

Now, let's talk about the Normalization layer. It works like an assistant, adjusting each input to make it more consistent
and highlighting the important parts. This helps the network learn faster and more effectively.

## 4

Add a Normalization layer from the LAYERS section.

## 5

Now, let's integrate these layers into the network. First, remove the connection between the Input layer and the first
Dense layer by selecting it and pressing Delete/Backspace.

## 6

Next, connect the Input layer to the Normalization layer.

## 7

Then, connect the Normalization layer to the Flatten layer.

## 8

Finally, connect the Flatten layer to the first Dense layer.

## 9

Your network is complete! The process now goes like this: The input images go through the Normalization layer, then the
Flatten layer, and finally the Dense layers, which will recognize the digit.

## 10

Well done! The only thing left is to train the network, which we'll cover in the next tutorial. See you there!
