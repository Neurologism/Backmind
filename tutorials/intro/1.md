Welcome to WhiteMind! I'm LeNet-5, and I'll be your guide through the exciting world of neural networks. Let's get started!

## 2

You’re in the WhiteMind Editor. Here, you'll create and configure your own neural networks. The toolbar on the left
contains all the building blocks you'll need. Go ahead and click on LAYERS in the toolbar.

## 3

Layers are the core components of your network. Think of each layer as a team of workers trying to solve a specific problem.

## 4

To get started, drag a Dense layer from the LAYERS section onto the Canvas area on the right.
This is where you'll build your network.

## 5

A Dense layer is versatile and can be used for many different tasks. It’s a great option when you don’t have a
specialized layer for the job. It’s like a team that can handle various tasks with ease.

## 6

Now let’s add another layer. Go back to the Toolbar, find the Input layer, and drag it above the Dense layer you just placed.

## 7

The Input layer is crucial as it serves as the entry point for data into the network. It’s like the first team that
collects the raw data before passing it on. To connect the Input layer to the Dense layer, simply drag the output of
the Input layer to the input of the Dense layer.

## 8

Great work! Next, we’ll add another Dense layer. Head back to the Toolbar and grab a Dense layer,
then drag it below the first one.

## 9

This second Dense layer will handle the final output of the network. To link the layers together, connect the output
from the first Dense layer to the input of this new Dense layer.

## 10

Fantastic! You’ve just created a simple neural network! In the next lesson, we’ll explore the settings of each layer.
We'll also introduce you to the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. Stay tuned!
