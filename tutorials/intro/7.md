Hey there! Welcome back! You've done a fantastic job with the Wine Quality dataset so far. Now, let’s move on to the next step
— training your model to predict wine quality.

## 2

Recall that the model is like a manager of you project. It organizes everything, making sure the network is working and
evaluating its progress. Add the Model node from the MODELS section to the canvas.

## 3

Your model needs layers to function, like floors in a building. Connect the Model node to the Input layer and
the Output layer(second Dense layer).

## 4

Now that you’ve created the model, it’s time to set a loss function. We are working on a regression task, so we need a loss function
that can measure the difference between the predicted and actual wine quality. Select Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function for the Model node.

## 5

MSE helps the model understand how well it's performing. If the MSE is high, the model needs to improve; if it's low, the model is doing well.

## 6

In addition to the loss function, we also use metrics to evaluate how well the model is performing during training. However,
metrics are not the model’s main focus — they just give us an additional view. Think of metrics as sidekicks to the loss function.

## 7

For this task, we’ll use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the metric. It’s similar to MSE but calculates the average of the absolute differences between
the predicted and actual values. This gives a different view of the model's performance.

## 8

We'll also set the optimizer. An optimizer is like a strategy or plan for the model(manager) to follow. It
tells the model how to adjust itself to improve performance.

## 9

For now, we'll use the RMSprop optimizer. Don't worry about all the technical details now — just know that different optimizers
can help improve the performance of the model.

## 10

Now, we want to tell the model to start training. Add the Fit node from the MODELS section.

## 11

The Fit node needs to know which dataset it should use. Connect the x connection of the Fit node to the train connection
of the Wine Quality dataset.

## 12

You're all set! The model is set up with its layers, loss function, metric, optimizer, and training data. Hit the train
button to begin the training process.

## 13

You may notice that the model is not performing as well as expected. The MAE is quite high, meaning the model is consistently
making predictions that are far off from the true values. But don't worry! We'll look at ways to improve the model's performance in the next tutorial.
